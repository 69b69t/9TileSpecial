# 9TileSpecial

searches for minecraft seeds in versions 1.17 and below where at spawn, there is a configuration of 3x3 special tiles. there may be false positives because special tiles cant generate on ocean tiles. the current configuration uses 16 threads and works in chunks of 2^32 seeds per thread
